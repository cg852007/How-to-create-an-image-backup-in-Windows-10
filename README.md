<h1>How-to-create-an-image-backup-in-Windows-10</h1>

 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtube.com/)

<h2>Description</h2>
I wanted to start backing up my PC and phone. After some reseach I've decided to back them up physically and to the clould. I will use image backup and file backup for my physical storage options. A file backup copies your data files (photos, documents, etc.). An image backup will copy everything on your drive including boot sector, partions, programs, and settings. This will show how I back up my PC by creating a image backup to a 2TB flash drive.
